# Fritzing-USB-Connectors-Template
A simple PCB tool to assist Fritzing users in selecting (or identifying) USB connectors.

This is a simple PCB of USB connectors from the standard Fritzing components database plus any relevant additional USB parts I may find. I created it to help identify the parts I received in a pack of samples since doing it "by eye" was not always a simple task and there were a lot in a pack that do not match anything in Fritzing.

Provided here is a PDF file of the board if you wanted to just print it out, and Fritzing and Gerber files if you would like to have the board made. If you do get the board produced I recommend you use the ENIG manufacturing process due to the surface mount nature of some of the components. Any finish will suffice but the ENIG process produces very flat solder areas which can be useful for aligning parts or even straightening bent pins before soldering.

Have I missed something ? If so, please let me know.

At some point I would like to add more community submitted parts - if you know of any please tell me about it. Please point me to the relevant URL so I can link to the part, especially if it's the work of a forum member so they get some credit.
