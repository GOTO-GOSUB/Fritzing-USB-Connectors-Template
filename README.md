# Fritzing-USB-Connectors-Template
A simple PCB tool to assist Fritzing users in selecting (or identifying) USB connectors.

This is a simple PCB of USB connectors from the standard Fritzing components database. I created it to help identify the parts I received in a pack of samples since doing it "by eye" was not always a simple task.

Provided here is a PDF file of the board if you wanted to just print it out, and Fritzing and Gerber files if you would like to have the board made. If you do get the board produced I recommend you use the ENIG manufacturing process due to the surface mount nature of some of the components. Any finish will suffice but the ENIG process produces very flat solder areas which can be useful for aligning parts or even straightening bent pins before soldering.

Have I missed something ? If so, please let me know.

At some point I would like to do the same for the community submitted parts - if you know of one please tell me about it, I would like to add it to these so long as the source is traceable so tha I can add a link to the part.
